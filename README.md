# Cv2_Different_Fps_Screens
This project takes video streams from three cameras with different FPS (frames per second) values ​​and displays these streams in real time in different windows.

   ▷This piece of code takes a stream of images from a single camera and allows to display these images simultaneously in 3 different windows with different fps values.

   ▷When the user presses the "q" key, the program terminates and the windows are closed. 

   ▷The project uses multiple threads to process multiple camera streams simultaneously.
